## Overview

This project is built using modern web development tools to create a fast and responsive user interface. It leverages **React** for building UI components, **Vite** for a lightning-fast development environment, and **TypeScript** for type safety. The styling is managed with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components to ensure a sleek and customizable design. Data fetching is powered by **Axios** and **TanStack Query** for efficient and flexible API handling, and **React Router** is used for managing routes within the app.
